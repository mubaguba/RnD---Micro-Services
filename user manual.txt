Steps to get uwsgi in emperor mode running both RESTful API at once
- All the necessary code for the API's are stored in GitHub repository https://github.com/mubaguba/RnD---Micro-Services
- Keep everything in one folder
- Have your project folder, make sure it contains everything from the Flask RESTful API folder.
- Copy the RESTful.py file from Bottle RESTful API and add it to the project folder (you don't need the other ones as they are already with the Flask files)
- Create a vassals folder inside the project folder which will contain bottle.ini and Flask.ini
- With all these steps followed, now go to the projects location using the terminal or any other tool.
- now to get uwsgi in emperor mode to run both API's type in the terminal uwsgi --emperor vassals --uid http --gid http --master
- This should run both API's at once, to make sure it works it will state that both config files (bottle.ini, me.ini) are ready to accept requests
- Once this is completed, you can now use requests from both API's
- to use requests for the Bottle API, the url is "0.0.0.0:5001/todo" and for Flask "0.0.0.0:5000/todo".
- These two should output the data from the todo table.

curl Statements
- curl -X GET 0.0.0.0:5000/todo/14
- curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @todo.json 0.0.0.0:5000/todo
- curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d @todo.json 0.0.0.0:5000/todo/10
- curl -X DELETE 0.0.0.0:5000/todo/9

To use curl statements for Flask use 0.0.0.0:5001/todo
